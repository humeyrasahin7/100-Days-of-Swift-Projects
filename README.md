These projects are contain both instructions and challanges which are answers are not provided by the instructor.

 - Project 2: A simple game to practice for using UI Alert Controller, UIButton
 - Project 3: About sharing data type that we want to share. Exp: Dowloading selected picture.
 - Milestone 1: Combine of project 1, 2 and 3 besides it contains little icons (images of flags) on the table view.
 - Project 4: First time we used WebBrowser, WebKit, WKWebView, KVO and delegation. 
 - Project 5: About reading text file from the disk by using contentsOfFile, getting input string from the user and finding invalid/used words bys using UITextChecker. Multiple navigation bar button item is added. It is a some kind of a scrable game.
 - Project 6: Just a simple example for how to use auto layouts, aspect ratio and auto layout anchors.
 - Milestone 2: A simple to do/shopping list by using tableView and action controller's text input. User can restart to listing after refreshing the table view by refresh navigation bar button item. 
 - Project 7: An example of how to read data from a html file/api and how to filter them. Plus we learned how to use tab bar controller and add multiple buttons.
 - Project 8: Entire user interface build in code. Text alignment, layout margins, UIFont are used. And the other used methods are addTarget, joined, didSet, enumerated.
 - Prpject 9: This project is an updated version of the project 7. Used the GCD framework to fetch the data in background. Learned about QoS, and performSelector method which is more easy version of async().
 - Project 9 Challenges: Project 1, 8 and 7 modified by using GCD to fetch and process datas.
 - Milestone 3: A simple hangman game. Used techniques are creating components and adding constraints all by code, didSet method.
 - Project 10: This project is some kind of picture board which you can add picture and its name. UICollectionViewController, UIImagePickerController are used.
 - Project 11: This project is the first time I used the SpriteKit to make games. Key points are SKSpriteNode, SKPhysicsBody, SKAction.
 - Project 12a and 12b: This is an updated version of Project 10 by using NSCoding, Codable, UserDefaults, NSKeyedArchiver, NSKeyedUnarchiver
 - Milestone 4: We put two different projects into one: by letting users take photos of things that interest them, add captions to them, then show those photos in a table view. Tapping the caption should show the picture in a new view controller, like we did with project 1, and we also used UserDefaults to remember the items that user added like in Project 12.
 - Project 13: This project is an image filtering app by using CIImage, UISlider, CIContext, CIFilter.
